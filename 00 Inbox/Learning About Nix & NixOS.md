# Learning About Nix & NixOS

I first heard of nix and nixos in a programming video where they were talking about linux, containers, docker, deployment solutions etc. I didn't really think about it a lot but the main idea seemed interesting.

Second year of university, I was looking for a new linux distro after I got bored with fedora on my laptop. I remembered hearing about this new nix thing and I decided to try it out. What could go wrong?

I'm still learning about nix system and NixOS and let me tell you this, the learning curve is pretty intense. There's so many information about nix and nixos but there's no structured way to learn it so you end up confused and frustrated because you don't know which path to take when there are thousands of different paths to choose from.

# Nix Language

This is my notes about nix language. I sometimes forget stuff about the main language itself because it is a functional DSL and it's quite different from every other language I've ever used.
