# ⭐ Derin’s Essentialist Second Brain

This is my Obsidian vault, my second brain, thinking space, idea machine, and archive of everything I care about.  
It’s built around **essentialism**, **simplicity**, and **actual work**, not endless organization.

I don’t want a digital garden.  
I don’t want a productivity system.  
I want a place where I can think.

# 🌱 Why This Exists

I get distracted easily. ADHD or not, my mind jumps around — fast, chaotic, powerful, messy. That can be a curse, but also a superpower when I direct it.

This vault is how I:
- reduce friction
- cut out noise
- keep only what matters
- think clearly
- connect ideas
- and actually _produce_ things instead of drowning in tabs

Essentialism isn't about owning less notes, it’s about removing everything that doesn’t help me think.

# 🧱 The Structure

This is an **ultra-flexible, zero-maintenance structure**.  
Only three folders. No categories. No micromanagement.  
Everything I learn or think naturally connects through links.

```
00 Inbox/
10 Notes/
20 Projects/
```

That’s it.
Below is what each one does.

## 📥 00 Inbox

This is where **everything starts**.

Fast notes, thoughts, quotes, ideas, phrases, random concepts, video links, things I don’t want to forget... they all go here.

I don’t organize this.  
I don't obsess over keeping it clean.
I don’t judge notes when I create them.

Once a day (or whenever I feel like it), I look at the inbox:

- if it’s useless → delete  
- if it’s meaningful → turn it into a **Permanent Note** and improve upon
- if it belongs to a project → move to the project folder

Nothing else. Zero overhead.

## 🧠 10 Notes

These are the refined ideas, they're things I’ve thought about, processed, researched, understood, or expressed clearly.

Every permanent note is:
- **atomic** (one clear idea)
- **short** 
- **focused** 
- **linked** to other notes 

This creates a *web of interconnected thinking* without me ever having to organize anything manually.

Topics aren’t separated by folders because they self-organize through **links, backlinks, and search**.

Math mixes with psychology.  
Philosophy connects with programming.  
Training ideas connect with neuroscience.  
Everything builds on everything.

Exactly how a real brain works.

## 🛠️ 20 Projects

Each active project gets *one folder*:

```
20 Projects/
	Project A/
	Project B/
	Project C/
```

That’s the only rule.

Inside each project I can have:
- sketches  
- research notes  
- code snippets  
- outlines  
- Kanban boards  
- draft writing  

Projects are allowed to be messy because projects are real, not aesthetic.
When a project is done, I archive it or leave it as-is.

# 🔗 The Philosophy

- **No useless tags** unless absolutely necessary  
- **No complex hierarchies**  
- **No endless categorizing**  
- **No “perfect workflow” obsession**  
- **No plugin addiction**  

Just:
- Capture  
- Think  
- Link  
- Create

This system lets ideas collide and form new ones.  
It’s a tool for creativity, not digital housekeeping.

## What's Next

Anything and everything in this obsidian vault is a subject to change. Like the universe, only absolute truth is everything - without exception - is changing or will change; change is the the universe itself.
Hang around, give me constructive criticism, tell me you like what I'm trying to do, or just watch what I do from the shadows. I'll probably start a blog as well, to gain some publicity and share my thoughts on the *"inter-web"*.
